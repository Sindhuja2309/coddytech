Unique values

Let's assume we have the following table

sales

 	country	city	amount
1	Poland	Warsaw	13
2	Germany	Berlin	24
3	Poland	Katowice	56
And we would like to know all of the countries that the product was sold.

If we use the normal query we know: SELECT country from sales it will return Poland Germany Poland. This is not what we are looking for because Poland is repeated twice.

SOLUTION:
select distinct coin from sales
